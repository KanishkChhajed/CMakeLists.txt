CMakeJar
========

This folder contains an example on how to use the CMakeJar module.

Example compilation & testing
-----------------------------

```shell
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ../
```

If you didn't check out the full [daniperez/CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/daniperez/CMakeLists.txt)
repo, you'll have to provide the path to the CMake scripts used in this example, e.g.:

```shell
> cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=<path to my scripts> ../
```
